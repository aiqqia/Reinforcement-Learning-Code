    "The elevator domain models evening rush hours when people from different floors in a building want to go down to the bottom floor using elevators. To simplify, we consider there is **ONLY ONE** elevator in the building. The building has $L$ floors, the bottom floor is the ground floor *level 0*, the top floor is *level L-1*. The elevator can be at any floor, and it can move up and down. However, the elevator is very small, it can only take at most **ONE** passenger in it! (They definitely want to upgrade the building).\n",
    "\n",
    "We model the rules of the elevator as follows:\n",
    "1. Initially, the elevator is at the ground floor $l_0$, with the door closed.\n",
    "2. There will be some passengers waiting at some levels initially, which will be given by configurations.\n",
    "3. The door of the elevator can be open or closed, however, it can only move with the door closed.\n",
    "4. The elevator can only load or unload one passenger when the door is open.\n",
    "5. The people waiting at each level will be shown like a list with length `L`.\n",
    "6. The elevator is very small, so it can at most hold at most **ONE** passenger!\n",
    "7. The goal for each task is to make all passengers reach the bottom floor."
